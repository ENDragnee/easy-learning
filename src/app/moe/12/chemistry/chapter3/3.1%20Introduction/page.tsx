      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3.1 Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The industrial revolution of the 19th century marked the rapid development of chemical industries. This period saw a surge
        in the demand for goods produced through chemical processes. Today, chemical industries across the world, in both developed
        and developing countries, produce a vast array of useful products such as synthetic fibers, plastics, rubber, fertilizers,
        dyes, drugs, and many others.

      <p>
        Chemistry and chemical technology are crucial for economic growth and development, especially in developing countries like
        Ethiopia. Ethiopia is rich in mineral resources, including metal ores such as iron, lead, copper, gold, platinum, tantalum,
        and rare-earth metals. Additionally, resources like rock salt, gypsum, coal, and crude oil are also found. To fully utilize
        these resources, Ethiopia needs an industrial revolution to produce various chemicals on a large scale.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">What is Industrial Chemistry?</h3>
      <p>
        Industrial chemistry is a branch of chemistry that applies physical and chemical procedures to transform natural raw
        materials and their derivatives into products that are beneficial to humanity. It bridges the gap between academic chemistry
        and its commercial applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Industrial chemistry serves as the foundation of the chemical industry. The chemical industry produces a variety of
        essential goods, including food, medicines, building materials, and plastics. It involves the use of chemical processes,
        such as chemical reactions and refining methods, to create materials with desirable properties and quality that satisfy
        societal needs. These products may either be used directly by consumers or serve as inputs for other chemical industries.

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Utilize naturally or artificially available raw materials to produce desired products.</li>
        <li>Employ chemical reactions to transform raw materials into finished and semi-finished products.</li>
        <li>Consume large quantities of energy during the manufacturing process.</li>
        <li>Follow safe operation methods in their manufacturing processes.</li>
        <li>
          Test their products during and after manufacturing in quality control laboratories to ensure they meet the required
          specifications.
